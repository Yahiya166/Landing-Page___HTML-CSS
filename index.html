                        <p>A conference designed to empower you with knowledge and skills to deal with the most pressing
                            problems of running a dental practice. Network in an informal and welcoming space - grow
                            your network so you will never feel alone in your role. For those who are seasoned mangers
                            and those who are new or aspiring managers.</p>

                            and the same with your boss. At this conference you can ask the difficult questions and get
                            answers that you can implement immediately - AND you can meet like minded colleagues. After
                            all who is going to invest their time and money if they do not want to grow and be
                            successful?</p>
